            <h3>Prepare the toast</h3>
            <p>Put your <strong>slice</strong> of bread in the toaster for however long you'd prefer. After this, immediately transfer to a buttered or oiled pan and gently sear on both sides. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the egg</h3>
            <p>Fry the <strong>egg</strong>, in any which way you choose.</p>
            <p><em>I prefer over medium or scrambled for this application; it allows the eggs to still be jammy but not runny.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the dish</h3>
            <p>Add any liquid toppings onto your toast. Transfer the fried egg onto your toast. Sprinkle on remaining toppings to your liking.</p>
            <p><em>It's also possible to make another piece of toast and make this into an egg sandwich.</em></p>
