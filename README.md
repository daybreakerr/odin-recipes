This project is to make a basic website utilizing HTML knowledge and to commit it to GitHub using Git.

In review of this project, it's clear I've gained a surprisingly good understanding of HTML. I went a little overboard, in fact, as I decided to format the page and nest some of my tags for the lists provided. I feel satisfied with my knowledge at this point and I feel I'm ready to move on to bigger things.
